`prgen` is a tool for auto-generating GitHub PRs with the power of AI.

## Installation

Can be installed with brew.
Requires the `--no-quarantine` flag for macOS because it hasn't been notarized by Apple.

```bash
brew install --no-quarantine lugen4ro/homebrew-lugen4ro/prgen
```

## Usage

Just execute the `prgen` command in your git repository.
